                        <p class="service-description">
                            Back in middle and high school, I often helped classmates who were struggling with math. In
                            middle school, one of my
                            teachers even asked me to personally tutor a student who was close to failing. Over time, he
                            made significant progress
                            and was able to raise his grade into the B range—a transformation I was really proud of. In
                            high school, I continued
                            supporting peers who found math challenging, since it was a subject I both enjoyed and
                            excelled in. I credit much of
                            this passion to my dad, who would teach my brother and me advanced concepts during the
                            summers before we encountered
                            them in school. This early exposure not only gave us a head start but also helped me
                            discover that math becomes truly
                            enjoyable once you understand it deeply.

                            help out during our winter breaks while visiting our cousins in Phoenix, Arizona. It has
                            always been an extremely
                            rewarding experience, as we were able to package meals for children in need. Beyond the

                        <p class="service-description">
                            I have been playing chess for over half of my life, and throughout the years I have had the
                            privilege of learning from
                            many coaches. They not only taught me strategies and techniques for the game but also shared
                            valuable lessons that
                            extended far beyond the chessboard. One of the most meaningful insights I’ve gained is that
                            chess can serve as a
                            powerful metaphor for life—full of strategy, patience, and foresight. In the future, I hope
                            to pass on both the skills
                            of the game and the life lessons it represents to younger players. Teaching chess would be
                            incredibly rewarding, giving
                            me the opportunity to inspire the next generation while also sharpening my own skills and
                            deepening my connection to the
                            game.

                            To date, I have competed in over 150 official tournaments and am registered with the United
                            States Chess Federation
                            (USCF). The federation’s database provides a record of every player’s official matches,
                            results, and tournament history,

                        <p class="service-description">
                            As I continue improving my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, one of my goals is to begin
                            helping smaller companies
                            build their websites—creating professional, functional sites that are good enough to
                            establish their online presence. To
                            the right is an example of a site professionally made for my mom’s brokerage. In the past,
                            she asked my brother and me
                            to build a site, but at the time we were “too busy” and lacked the necessary experience.
                            Now, with a strong foundation
                            in web development, I want to be prepared to take on opportunities like that. My goal is to
                            ensure that if a small
                            business or startup needs a website but is working with limited resources, I can provide an
                            affordable and effective
                            solution to help them get started.
