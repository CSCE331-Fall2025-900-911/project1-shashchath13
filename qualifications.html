                <div class="interest-item">
                    <h4 class="interest-title">Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning</h4>
                    <p class="interest-description">
                        I'm pursuing a minor in AI in Business because I believe artificial intelligence will
                        fundamentally transform how we solve complex problems across industries—a shift we are already
                        witnessing today.
                        I am particularly interested in how AI can be applied to real-world business challenges, from
                        automating routine tasks to delivering intelligent insights for decision-making.
                        The intersection of technical capability and business application fascinates me, and I see
                        enormous potential for AI to create meaningful impact in fields ranging from healthcare to
                        education.
                        These opportunities are what make this area especially exciting to me.

                    <h4 class="interest-title">Cybersecurity</h4>
                    <p class="interest-description">
                        I am pursuing a cybersecurity minor, reflecting my deep concern about the growing threat
                        landscape in our digital world.
                        With cyber attacks becoming increasingly sophisticated and frequent, I believe cybersecurity
                        professionals play a crucial role in protecting individuals, businesses, and critical
                        infrastructure.
                        I am particularly interested in ethical hacking, threat analysis, and developing secure systems
                        from the ground up.
                        The cat-and-mouse nature of cybersecurity—where defenders must constantly adapt to stay ahead of
                        attackers—appeals to the problem-solving mindset I have carried since childhood.

                    <h4 class="interest-title">Software Engineering & Development</h4>
                    <p class="interest-description">
                        Software engineering excites me because it combines creativity with logical problem-solving. I
                        enjoy taking complex requirements and breaking them down into manageable, well-designed
                        solutions.
                        My experience
                        building the Teeko game, as well as completing various coding assignments, has shown me how
                        satisfying
                        it is to see code come to life as a functional
                        application.
                        I’m particularly interested in exploring how my applications can grow and scale over time.
