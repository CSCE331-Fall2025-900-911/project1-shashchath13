                            In ENGR 102 (Introduction to Python), my group developed a terminal-based implementation of
                            the board game Teeko as our
                            final project. The project was organized into multiple files, including separate modules for
                            game logic, win conditions,
                            and tie scenarios. As the most technically experienced member of the team, I took the lead
                            in developing the main game
                            file, integrating the supporting modules, and ensuring smooth functionality. My teammates
                            contributed by creating the
                            auxiliary files and assisting with debugging and testing, resulting in a fully functional
                            and interactive game.

                        <p class="project-description">
                            In my CSCE 314 course, I developed a Cheese Sandwich Food Truck simulator using JavaFX and
                            SceneBuilder. This was an
                            individual project, requiring careful time management and iterative development to complete
                            each component of the
                            application. The project was structured so that every stage of the food truck process
                            corresponded to a dedicated Java
                            and FXML file, which I then integrated to allow seamless navigation between views. The final
                            product, shown in the image
                            on the right, includes both a customer-facing interface and an admin panel for managing
                            inventory. Access to the
                            administrative side is secured with a password prompt, and it provides functionality to
                            restock supplies and monitor
                            operations.

                            Over the summer of 2025, I rekindled my passion for drawing, creating a substantial
                            collection of original artwork. I
                            carefully documented my creative process, from preliminary pencil sketches to marker tracing
                            and final coloring and
                            shading. I plan to develop a dedicated website to showcase my drawings, organizing related
                            pieces from the same
                            universes into themed sections or tabs. Each section would feature its own unique design and
                            background, inspired by
                            websites I admire (such as the one linked below) that use interactive tab layouts to enhance
                            user experience. This project will leverage the web
                            development skills I have applied in my current portfolio, while also integrating artistic
                            and visual design techniques
                            to present the artwork in an engaging, dynamic, and organized manner.

                        <p class="project-description">
                            I was introduced to Legos at a very young age, and throughout my life, I have consistently
                            built and collected them. My
                            brother and I spent countless hours creating imaginative stories, some rivaling blockbuster
                            movies in creativity. Over
                            time, many sets were broken or lost to what Lego enthusiasts call "The Bin"—large containers
                            holding miscellaneous
                            pieces.

                            During the summer of 2025, I rediscovered my passion for Legos, inspired by restoration
                            videos I saw online. I began
                            salvaging and restoring sets that had been lost or damaged, discovering along the way that
                            many minifigures were
                            mismatched or incomplete, much like the mischievous Sid from Toy Story.

                            I plan to develop a personal website to catalog my Lego collection, including all sets and
                            their associated minifigures.
                            Sets will be organized by theme, with each theme featuring a unique layout and background.
                            This site will serve as both
                            a digital inventory to track my collection and as a showcase to share it with others without
                            needing in-person viewing,
                            while highlighting the creativity and history behind each set.

                        <p class="project-description">
                            Growing up, I spent countless hours playing chess and immersing myself in the world of
                            Mario. As a child, I always
                            dreamed of owning a Mario-themed chess set, but it was never feasible due to its cost. This
                            idea has stayed with me, and
                            I now plan to combine my love for chess with my interest in creative design to build a
                            personalized chess game with an
                            engaging user interface.

                            The project will feature a start menu where users can select from multiple themes, each
                            generating a unique board and
                            set of pieces. For example, choosing a Mario theme would present a board with pieces
                            inspired by the Mario universe. I
                            intend to expand this concept to include themes from my favorite shows, animes, and
                            fictional worlds, creating a
                            visually engaging experience that blends strategy and nostalgia. This project will allow me
                            to apply my skills in GUI
                            design, event handling, and dynamic graphics, while also delivering a personal, imaginative
                            twist on a classic game.
